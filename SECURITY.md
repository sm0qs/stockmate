# Security

This project does not collect or transmit any user data. All operations are performed locally on the user's machine. However, as the application is still in its early stages, users should exercise caution and avoid using it with sensitive data until it reaches a more stable release.
Any security vulnerabilities discovered should be reported via GitHub Private Security Reporting.
